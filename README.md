# RECI-RPDTestHelper
Perform automated comparisons between generated RPD files and reference RPD files using a set of test comparison specs. Comparison specs define the data paths, evaluation criteria, and tolerances used for each data element that is pertinent to a test case.

Note: This tool allows all objects in the energy models EXCEPT for Zones to be named however you would like. 

The zones must be closely aligned with the reference RPD files' zone names:
- Core Zone 1
- Prm Zone 1 (South)
- Prm Zone 2 (East)
- Prm Zone 3 (North)
- Prm Zone 4 (West)

If you encounter any issues with the tool, please open an issue on GitHub.
